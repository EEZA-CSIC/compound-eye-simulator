# toBeeView - compound-eye-vision
A program for simulating the retinal image of visual scenes on compound eyes.
This is a program that extracts from a digital photograph an approximation of the image formed at the sampling station stage in the eye of an animal viewing the scene at a distance d. 
The program takes into account the structure of the eye in terms of optics and photoreceptor spacing, but ignores the spectral sensitivity of photoreceptors.
